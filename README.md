📊 Customer Behavior Analysis & Segmentation
Marketing Analytics • Clustering • Campaign Optimization

This project explores customer behavior using demographic, spending, and engagement data.
The goal is to uncover insights that improve marketing performance and guide data-driven customer segmentation.

🚀 Project Objectives

Clean and prepare customer marketing data

Analyze spending behavior and campaign responsiveness

Identify key drivers of customer engagement

Build customer segments using machine learning (K-Means)

Evaluate campaign performance per segment

Generate insights to optimize marketing strategy

🧼 Data Preparation

Key engineered features:

Total_Spent – Sum of spending across product categories

Total_Purchases – Total web, catalog, and store purchases

Age – Derived from Year of Birth

Total_Children – Combined number of kids and teens

Total_Accepted_Campaigns – Count of accepted marketing campaigns

Missing values were imputed, numeric inconsistencies cleaned, and features standardized for clustering.

📊 Key Insights
Spending Behavior

Higher income strongly predicts higher spending

Families with more children spend significantly less

Frequent shoppers are big spenders

Campaign Performance

Customers who purchased recently are 20% more likely to respond to campaigns

High-income and high-spending customers are more receptive

🧩 Customer Segments

Using K-Means (k = 4), four meaningful clusters were identified:

Segment 0 — Active Senior Shoppers

High spenders, high purchase frequency, older age group.

Segment 1 — Young Low Spenders

Low income, low spending, minimal engagement.

Segment 2 — Large Budget Families

Older adults with many children, low spending, low income.

Segment 3 — High-Income Premium Buyers

Top spenders, highly responsive to marketing, frequent purchasers.

🎯 Strategic Recommendations
